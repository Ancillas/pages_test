Description: Centralized configuration management
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
 .
 This package contains the puppet software and documentation.  For the startup
 scripts needed to run the puppet agent and master, see the "puppet" and
 "puppetmaster" packages, respectively.
